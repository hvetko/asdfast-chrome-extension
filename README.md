# ASDFast Google Chrome extension
This is a Google Chrome Extension that allows Right click random text (Lorem Ipsum) generator. When added to chrome, adds new context menu item named *Insert AsdFast Text*.

## Highlights
Extension checks element size and padding, sends that info to [ASDFast API](http://asdfast.beobit.net/docs.php) which calculates amount of text that needs to be retrieved. As result, entire input field is populated with text. 

## Installation and usage
Add to Chrome from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lorem-ipsum-generator-asd/fcoicojljhpobficoigooibpgkflmggl).  

Right-click any editable input field, choose `Insert AsdFast Text` from context menu. Field should be filled with text now.  

NOTE: Does not work with WYSIWYG editors in WYSIWYG mode.
